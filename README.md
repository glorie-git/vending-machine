# vending-machine

SCHOOL PROJECT

CODE RUNS BUT IS NOT FULLY FUNCTION

OBJECTIVE

To design a fully functional vending machine controller (VMC) in VHDL. Students will apply their digital design knowledge and various FSM principles to implement the hardware components necessary to realize a coin operated VMC based on a set of specifications. The machine will support four modes of operation: vending mode, program mode, display mode, and free mode. Consumers will use the vending and display mode, and vending machine operators the program, display, and free mode. Distinction between consumer and user was not be necessary in the context of this project.
